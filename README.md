# MLOps for NLP Modelization with BERT

## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing MLOps best practices for Natural Language Processing (NLP) Classification of AI articles. The primary goal is to deploy and manage a fine-tuned model using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) encoder and BERT Language Model Masked LM (LLM).

## Objectives

1. **Model Finetuning:**
   - Utilize a pre-trained BERT model for NLP tasks.
   - Implement fine-tuning on the BERT model with specific NLP datasets - AI Articles to classify.

2. **MLOps Implementation:**
   - Apply MLOps best practices for the development, deployment, and monitoring of the NLP model.
   - Establish a robust CI/CD pipeline for continuous integration and delivery.

3. **Model Deployment:**
   - Deploy the fine-tuned BERT model using containerization (Docker).
   - Utilize cloud-based services for scalable and reliable model deployment.

4. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Implement logging and monitoring solutions to track model performance and system health.

5. **Scalability:**
   - Design the architecture to handle varying workloads and scale the model accordingly.
